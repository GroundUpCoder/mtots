# mtots VSCode Extension

VSCode support for the mtots programming language

Only syntax highlighting supported for now.
Will support more features in the future once the `mtots`
language itself is more fleshed out.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.5

Bugfix for when modules cannot be found.

### 0.0.4

Actual smart language features!
Diagnostics, goto-definition, auto-completes based on variables in scope and
members available for a given value; parameter hints.

Likely still lots of bugs that need to be squashed. Will address them
as I use this extension and find them.

### 0.0.3

`try` and `raise` are valid keywords

### 0.0.2

Properly color line comments

### 0.0.1

An extension is reborn~
