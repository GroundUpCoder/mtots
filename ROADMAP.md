Basic Roadmap for myself:

# Long Term Goals

I want `mtots` to eventually be a platform for quickly making
ideas come to life.

If you want to make an app, a game, a website, etc. - anything you might
want to do with software - for both professionals and hobbyists, I want it
to be easy to quickly see it come to life.

## Priorities

Batteries included - for every platform

Obviously, the scope here is so large that there's no way that I can do
everything all at once. But I will tackle each platform one at a time.
Once I feel I've created a pleasant developer experience and a
self-sustaining ecosystem in each area, I'll start on the next platform.

My current tentative order of platforms to tackle are:

  1. Game Development (SDL, ANGLE, etc - desktop, mobile, Steam, etc)
  2. Mobile Development
  3. Web development (Backend)
  4. Web development (Frontend)
  5. ???

# Short to Medium Term Timeline

### October 2022

Focus mainly on adding bindings I will need for making games

  * SDL bindings currently WIP,
  * ANGLE bindings to do next,
  * Steam API
  * Box2D?
  * Port of Processing/P5.js?
  * Bindings for dyncall?

Also investigate how to deploying to `itch.io` and `Steam` might work

### November 2022

Start developing a game
